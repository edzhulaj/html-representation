  <h1>Embedding Media</h1>
  <p>
    Embedding media in HTML involves integrating multimedia content like images,
    audio, and video directly into a webpage. This allows users to view or
    listen to these elements without having to download them separately or
    navigate to another site. HTML provides specific elements, such as
    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, to facilitate this embedding process, along with
    attributes to control their appearance and behavior.

    <h2>iframe</h2>
    <p>
      An <strong>iframe</strong> (Inline Frame) is an HTML element that allows
      you to embed another HTML document within the current HTML page. It
      essentially creates a window within your webpage where you can display
      content from a different source, such as another website, a video, or even
      another HTML file on your own server.

  <div id="video">
    <h2>Video</h2>
    The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element in HTML is used to embed video
    content directly into a webpage. It allows you to display video files,
    control playback, and provide options for users to interact with the video,
    such as pausing, playing, adjusting volume, and viewing in fullscreen. The
    element supports various video formats and attributes to customize the
    video's appearance and behavior.
  </div>
  <div id="audio">
    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>
      Audio on the web involves incorporating sound files into HTML documents.
      This allows users to listen to music, podcasts, or other audio content
      directly within a webpage. The HTML <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element is
      used to embed audio, providing attributes for controlling playback,
      displaying controls, and specifying multiple source files for browser
      compatibility.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="images">
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
      Images are a way to display visual content on a webpage. They are added to
      HTML documents using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, which links to an
      image file. Attributes like <strong>src</strong> (source),
      <strong>alt</strong>
      (alternative text), <strong>width</strong>, and
      <strong>height</strong> are used to specify the image's location,
      description, and dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in HTML is used to embed a simple image
      directly into a webpage. It requires a src attribute to specify the image
      source. On the other hand, the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element
      represents self-contained content, like an image, illustration, diagram,
      code snippet, etc., that is referenced as a single unit. It is typically
      used with the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element to provide a caption
      for the figure.
