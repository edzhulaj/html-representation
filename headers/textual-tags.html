  <h1>Textual Tags</h1>
  <div id="headings">
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings are used to define the titles and subtitles within a document.
      HTML provides six levels of headings, from
      <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> (the most important and largest) to
      <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> (the least important and smallest). They help
      structure content and improve readability by creating a clear hierarchy.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="title">
    <h2>Title Tag</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag in HTML defines the title of the HTML
      document. This title is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and
      it's also used for bookmarking pages and in search engine results. It's
      placed within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML document.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="paragraph">
    <h2>p Tag</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in HTML defines a paragraph. Browsers
      automatically add a single blank line before and after each paragraph,
      creating a clear separation between blocks of text. It's a block-level
      element, meaning it occupies the full width available to it and starts on
      a new line.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="hr">
    <h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag in HTML creates a thematic break in an
      HTML page and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. It's used to
      separate content visually, like dividing sections of text or indicating a
      change in topic. The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag is an empty element,
      meaning it doesn't have a closing tag.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="br">
    <h2>br Tag</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag in HTML creates a line break within a text
      block. It's used to start a new line without creating a new paragraph,
      effectively forcing the text that follows to appear on the next line. It
      is an empty element, meaning it has no closing tag.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="b-strong">
    <h2>b / strong</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags in HTML
      are used to make text appear bold. While both achieve a similar visual
      effect, the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag is primarily for stylistic
      purposes, indicating text that should be visually distinguished without
      necessarily conveying importance. On the other hand, the
      <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag signifies that the enclosed text has
      strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="pre">
    <h2>pre</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag in HTML represents preformatted text.
      Text inside a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element is displayed in a
      fixed-width font, and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. This is
      useful for displaying code snippets, ASCII art, or any other text where
      formatting is important.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="i-em">
    <h2>i / em</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags in HTML are
      used to emphasize text. The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag represents text
      that is set off from the normal prose, such as technical terms, foreign
      words, or thoughts. The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag represents stress
      emphasis of its contents. While both may render similarly in browsers
      (often as italicized text), <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> has semantic meaning,
      indicating importance, whereas <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> is purely
      presentational.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="mark">
    <h2>Mark Text</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> tag in HTML is used to highlight specific
      parts of text within a larger block of content. It's primarily intended to
      draw the reader's attention to these sections, often because they are
      relevant to the user's current activity or search query. The default
      styling usually renders the marked text with a yellow background, but this
      can be customized using CSS.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="sub">
    <h2>Subscript Text</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> tag in HTML is used to display text as
      subscript. Subscript text appears slightly below the normal line of text
      and is typically rendered in a smaller font size. It's commonly used for
      mathematical formulas, chemical formulas, or footnotes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="sup">
    <h2>Supscript Text</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> tag in HTML is used to display text as
      superscript. Superscript text appears slightly above the normal line of
      text and is typically rendered in a smaller font size. It's commonly used
      for things like exponents, ordinal numbers (e.g., 1st, 2nd), and
      footnotes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="links">
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links, also known as hyperlinks, are elements that connect one web
      resource to another. They allow users to navigate between different pages
      on the same website or to external websites. Links are created using the
      <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag, and they can point to various types
      of resources, including HTML pages, images, documents, and more.
