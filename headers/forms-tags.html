  <h1>Using Forms</h1>
  <p>
    Forms in HTML are used to collect data from users. They provide a way for
    users to input information like text, passwords, and selections, and then
    submit that data to a server for processing. Forms are created using the
    <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element, which contains various input elements
    like <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and
    <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> to define the different fields for user input.

    <h2>Labels and Inputs</h2>
    <p>
      Labels and inputs are fundamental building blocks for creating forms in
      HTML. Labels provide descriptive text that tells users what information is
      expected in a corresponding input field. Input elements, on the other
      hand, are the interactive controls where users can enter data, such as
      text, numbers, dates, or make selections from options. They work together
      to create a user-friendly and accessible form experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are <strong>two ways</strong> to pair a label and an input. One is
      by wrapping the input in a label (implicit), and the other is by adding a
      for attribute to the label and an id to the input (explicit).
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;label&gt;
        Name:
        &lt;input type="text" name="name" /&gt;
      &lt;/label&gt;
    </pre>
    <label>
      Name:
      <input type="text" name="name" />
    </label>
    <p>
      An explicit label’s for attribute value must match its input’s id value.
      For example, if for has a value of name, then id should also have a value
      of name.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name: &lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" /&gt;
    </pre>
    <label for="name">Name: </label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
    <p>
      Unfortunately, an implicit label is not handled correctly by all assistive
      technologies, even if for and id attributes are used. Therefore, it is
      always the best idea to use an explicit label instead of an implicit
      label.
