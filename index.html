        <h2>!DOCTYPE Declaration</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration is an instruction to the
          web browser about the HTML version used to write the page. It's placed
          at the very top of an HTML document, before the
          <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, and ensures that the browser renders
          the page in "standards mode," following the correct specifications for
          that HTML version. Technically, It is not an HTML tag itself.

        <h2>HTML Element</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is the root element of an HTML
          page. It tells the browser that this is an HTML document. All other
          HTML elements (except for the
          <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration) must be descendants of the
          <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.

      <div id="body">
        <h2>Body Tag</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in HTML defines the main content of
          an HTML document. It contains all the visible elements of a webpage,
          such as text, images, links, tables, lists, and more. Think of it as
          the container for everything you actually see and interact with on a
          website.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="head">
        <h2>head</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element in HTML acts as a container for
          metadata (data about data) about the HTML document. This metadata
          isn't displayed on the page itself, but it provides information like
          the document's title, character set, linked stylesheets, scripts, and
          other important configurations that help browsers and search engines
          understand and process the HTML document correctly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="meta">
        <h2>Meta Tags</h2>
        <p>
          Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a webpage.
          This data is not displayed on the page itself but is used by browsers,
          search engines, and other web services to understand the content and
          purpose of the page. They are placed within the
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of an HTML document and can specify
          information like character set, description, keywords, author, and
          viewport settings.
